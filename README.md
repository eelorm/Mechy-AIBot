Mechy- The Vehicle Repair Bot 

The system will be able to search its database of common vehicle problems like repairing a flat tire, vehicle stuck in the mud, overheating engine, dead battery etc. The user can report any or a combination of these problems and the system will provide a detailed step-by-step instructions on the tools required and how to fix these problems. For larger emergencies, the bot will provide the contact details of emergency roadside assistance, to help tow the car. While listing out the tools and the procedure, the bot will move on to the next instruction only after user acknowledgment. It will also have the option to repeat the same procedure or go back to the last procedure. 
The application is currently a web application built using Javascript and HTML/CSS and uses api.ai for NLU module.
